# phaser-ants

This is my first game in phaser.

I'd like to build a simulation engine, similar to that of terrarium or
one of the ai challenges from google.

To be successful:

1. you can upload a program
2. There are multiple "players" / npc(?).
3. You can edit the players and change their code.
4. you can visualize the program being performed

Other thoughts:

1. you can play the game manually, or you can code it up
2. you can share goals with players and they perform those on your behalf.
3. there is some fairness for the amount of code that can run.
4. All players have the same powers, just some specialize.

Components
1. uploader (hardcode in the sourcecode for now)
2. ui (websocket to phaser to show the game state)
